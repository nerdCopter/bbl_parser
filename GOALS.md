## Current Implementation Status (July 12 2025)

âœ… **COMPLETED GOALS:**
- Full BBL binary format parsing using JavaScript blackbox-log-viewer and C blackbox-tools references
- Complete I, P, S, H, G, E frame parsing with proper predictor implementation
- Header parsing and field definition extraction with firmware metadata
- CSV export with blackbox_decode compatible field ordering and formatting
- Headers CSV export with complete configuration and frame definitions
- Proper field encoding/decoding (SIGNED_VB, UNSIGNED_VB, NEG_14BIT, TAG8_8SVB, TAG2_3S32, TAG8_4S16)
- Motor value prediction with accurate P-frame decoding
- S-frame timestamp inheritance and data merging with main CSV stream
- Multi-log detection and separate file generation (.01.csv, .02.csv, etc.)
- Basic unit conversions (voltage, current) with proper scaling
- Energy calculation (energyCumulative field) integration
- Time-sorted CSV output with proper chronological ordering
- Debug mode with comprehensive frame-by-frame analysis and sampling
- Large file streaming support (500K+ frames) with memory efficiency
- **G-frame (GPS) parsing and GPX file export** with coordinate conversion
- **E-frame (event) parsing and JSONL event export** with Betaflight FlightLogEvent enum
- **Betaflight firmware-accurate flag formatting** (flightModeFlags, stateFlags, failsafePhase)
- **Official Betaflight event type mapping** (sync beep, disarm, flight mode change, log end)
- **Extensive Betaflight/EmuFlight testing** with high compatibility across firmware versions

ðŸ”§ **REMAINING WORK:**
- Code refinement: Replace unwrap() calls with proper error handling
- Enhanced error handling and comprehensive edge case testing
- Performance optimization for extremely large files (>1M frames)
- Comprehensive GPS and Event frame testing across more log types
- Unit conversion options (time, voltage, current, height, speed, rotation, acceleration)
- IMU simulation (roll/pitch/yaw angle computation from gyro/accel/mag)
- Current meter simulation and energy integration
- GPS merge option (integrate GPS data into main CSV)
- Raw mode output (unprocessed sensor values)
- Enhanced statistics output (frame counts, timing, loop statistics)
- Full RUST CRATE for library reusability and modularity
- API documentation and stability for library integration
- Extended firmware compatibility testing (older/newer versions)
- Advanced filtering and data processing options

Implement the actual BBL binary format specification by explicitly replicating the JavaScript code and/or the C code from the Betaflight blackbox-log-viewer and/or blackbox_decode using the following sources:
https://github.com/betaflight/blackbox-tools/blob/master/src/blackbox_decode.c
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/betaflight/blackbox-log-viewer/master/src/flightlog.js

The goal is to fully read, parse and decode binary BBL files. Do not re-invent, explicitly use the javascript and C as a source to create the RUST project's code.

### P, I, S frames:

Every BBL contains headers in plaintext which contain important information about the aircraft's settings, but more importantly, they contain details about the binary data and how to decode them:
`Field I name`
`Field I signed`
`Field I predictor`
`Field I encoding`
`Field P predictor`
`Field P encoding`
`Field S name`
`Field S signed`
`Field S predictor`
`Field S encoding`

Each BBL may or may not contains multiple flights logs. Each flight log starts with it's own set of plaintext headers. Each flight log within a BBL will contain I frames and P frames, and maybe contain E frames and S frames and G frames. G frames are GPS. H frames are GPS home position markers.

Binary utility `blackbox_decode` outputs useful statistics and creates `.csv`, `.gpx`, and `.event` files that contain the flightlog data.  We can use it for data comparison, but do not embed nor call binary tools from within the RUST program. `blackbox_decode --limits` can be used for any `*.BBL` file.  The `--limits` is only useful to see the min and max `loopIteration` and `time`.

Two RUST projects on github that may help or may hinder, i do not know. I never inspected the first, and the second is betaflight version specific and not up to date for Betaflight 4.6.
