- The program is RUST and should be maintained as `src/main.rs` for the entry point.
- Do not remove nor modify comments unless the related code was modified.
- Only add comments as it pertains to the function of the code; do not add A.I. instructional comments.
- Never embed or call external binaries from within the RUST program.
- If you make temporary `.rs` files, then use `_temp.rs` extension.
- Make sure there are no errors and no warnings for RUSTS' `cargo build --release`.
- Do not `cat` to files, edit the files inline.
- When choosing mathematical or scientific methods, compare to alternative methods for accuracy and efficiency.  We want to be accurate with balanced efficiency.
- When choosing mathematical or scientific methods, fact-check decisions.
- Information to maintain:
  - Maintain a proper Readme.md file
  - Output your final summaries to ./INFORMATION/*.md files for human review (not to be included in the git project.) Filenames should be CAPITALS with lower-case `.md`. List new files when created.
- Goals reosurces:
  - Reference project goals in `Goals.md` and request clarification when needed.
- Usable source-code resources:
  - Use blacbox-log-viewer (a.k.a BBE, a.k.a. blackbox-explorer) https://github.com/betaflight/blackbox-log-viewer/blob/master/src/flightlog.js as the source for all BBL reading, parsing and decoding.
  - If something seems wrong or missing, we can use the older blackbox_decode (a.k.a blackbox-tools) project https://github.com/betaflight/blackbox-tools/blob/master/src/blackbox_decode.c to compare.
- Committing rules:
  - Only commit when there are no errors and no warnings.
  - When commiting, only commit `src/**/*.rs`, `Cargo.*`, `Readme.md`, and .gitignore files only. (never `git add .`; never `git add -A`)
  - Check `git diff --cached` before committing to see exactly what's being committed
  - When committing ask user first. 
  - When committing, use concide message and description of the changes implemented.
